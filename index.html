        <!-- Characteristic -->
        <h2>Merida's Characteristics</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Free-spirited – not to be forced into a mold but rather to be herself.</li>
            <li>Headstrong – stubborn is great when you succeed. But it looks like selfishness when you do not. Merida succeeded.</li>
            <li>Tomboyish – but still a princess. It’s tough to balance being athletic and boy-like while also still being a girl. Merida showed how it can be done.</li>
            <li>Softness of heart – strong yet tender. A great balance. This powerful and adept girl still loved her mother and father. Especially her mother.</li>
        </ol>
